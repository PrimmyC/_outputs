ISARIC4C Tier 0/CO-CIN fed data dynamically through the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP) to Public Health
Scotland, Public Health England, SPI-M, NERVTAG and SAGE. SPI-M have
been highly productive and published several analysis that informed
Policy.

The data were used to inform the NHS England Independent Advisory Group concerning the use of neutralising monoclonal antibodies and anti-viral drugs in high-risk clinical subgroups.
