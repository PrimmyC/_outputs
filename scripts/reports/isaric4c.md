# Co-Infection with influenza virus is associated with worse outcomes in hospitalised Covid patients

[SAGE minutes](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1055478/S1517_Influenza_virus_coinfection_is_associated_with_worse_COVID-19_outcomes_COCIN.pdf)
This analysis provides a clear answer to a simple question: what is the effect of co-infection with common viruses on top of Covid? We compared outcomes across people who tested positive for three different viruses (influenza (flu) virus, adenovirus, and RSV) and found that co-infection with the flu virus was associated a higher chance of critical illness and death. 
This has direct implications for the NHS, suggesting that we should test patients more often for flu. It also provides another reason to vaccinate people more widely against both flu and Covid, particularly as flu is expected to make a comeback in 2022. 
As with much of our work, this was discussed immediately at the UK government advisory group, SAGE, and has already influenced the thinking around policy.

# Sharing samples and data

ISARIC4C was designed from the outset as a foundation for the UK outbreak response, supporting researchers across the country.

The 4C consortium has:

-  Responded to clinical 120 data requests, providing data to 100 collaborators
-  Shipped out a total of 21,000 samples from our hub labs in Liverpool and Glasgow
-  Provided sample sets to 21 different institutions (Universities, Public Health England, NIBSC, Francis Crick Inst., NIH)

Dynamic data feeds from the [data analysis platform](/ap) are provided via API to Public Health in England & Scotland & SPI-M with independent reports prepared by them for NERVTAG and SAGE.

# Impacting Policy

ISARIC4C Tier 0/CO-CIN fed data dynamically through the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP) to Public Health
Scotland, Public Health England, SPI-M, NERVTAG and SAGE. SPI-M have
been highly productive and published several analysis that informed
Policy.

The data were used to inform the NHS England Independent Advisory Group concerning the use of neutralising monoclonal antibodies and anti-viral drugs in high-risk clinical subgroups.

# Risk prediction: the 4C Mortality Score

Using data from 57, 824 hospital admissions, we developed and validated an easy-to-use risk stratification score based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups. Generation of the 4C mortality score was supported by the [Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP)](odap.ac.uk).

The 4C Mortality Score can be found here: [isaric4c.net/risk](/risk)

The 4C Mortality Score has been extensively validated in independent studies across the world. Validation of the 4C score showed similar discrimination in the following countries:

Using data from the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, a [prospective validation study](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/early/2021/11/21/thoraxjnl-2021-217629) showed that both the 4C Mortality Score and 4C Deterioration Score demonstrated consistent performance to predict clinical deterioration and mortality. Despite recent advances in the treatment and management of adults hospitalised with COVID-19, both scores can continue to inform clinical decision making.

# Characterisation of hospitalised cases of COVID-19

Within weeks of being funded, we produced the largest study anywhere in the world of COVID-19 cases, enabling us to produce the most accurate risk prediction models for the UK population. These will continue to improve. The first one shows that obesity is an important risk factor amongst many. This finding will help to protect people at high risk of death from COVID-19. Our preprint is now online **Features of 16,749 hospitalised UK patients with COVID-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol**. We have also produced an [interactive infographic](/risk/v1) to help communicate these findings.

# Genetic mechanisms of severe Covid-19

In collaboration with the [ISARIC GenOMICC study](https://genomicc.org) we discovered multiple genes that underlie critical illness in Covid-19, including several that led directly to potential therapeutic targets. 
In 2244 Covid cases, we compared severely ill patients with matched members of the population from three other studies (UK Biobank, Generation Scotland and 100,000 Genomes). We found genes involved in two molecular processes - antiviral immunity and lung inflammation - were important in determining the development of severe Covid-19.  We replicated our findings in additional studies (Covid-19 HGI and 23andme). The associations with disease are robustly confirmed in these studies.
Although we know the DNA associations are real, we can't always be sure exactly how these variants lead to disease. The most likely genes underlying each of the four new discoveries are IFNAR2, TYK2, OAS1, DPP9.
The action of some genetic variants is similar the the action of drugs - either increasing or decreasing the amount of a particular molecule or signal. We can use this to predict new treatments. This evidence has influenced the inclusion of baricitinib in the RECOVERY trial.

# Characterisation of in-hospital complications associated with COVID-19

As well as death, severe COVID-19 disease has effects on many different organ systems. In this study, published in The Lancet, we characterised the burden of complications and organ injury in 73,197 patients admitted to hospital between January and August 2020. We found that nearly 1 in 2 people had at least one complication. Having a complication was associated with higher rates of critical care admission and mortality. When we studied predictors of complications, we identified that unlike in the case of mortality, where older, more frail people had a higher chance of death, younger people were also at risk of developing complications. This study received international media attention and coverage from the BBC, ABC, Sky news, ITV, STV and most major UK newspapers.
This work was also the subject of a system-wide [NIHR update](https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/one-in-two-people-hospitalised-with-covid-19-develop-complications-may-need-support/).

# Treating COVID-19 patients with dexamethasone and remdesivir prevents neurological complications

Preventing the development of neurological complications after severe COVID-19 infections remains an important aim for doctors. Data from the ISARIC4C study group showed that individuals who go on to have neurological issues after being hospitalised with COVID-19 do not recover as well and have an increased risk of death. This study showed that patients treated with dexamethasone, a commonly used steroid, or remdesivir, an antiviral drug first used in hepatitis C, were less likely to have neurological issues than those who were not treated. The use of both of these drugs together further reduced the risk of complications.

# Circulating histones play a central role in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and mortality

COVID-19 has highlighted the lethal consequences of immunothrombosis; i.e. the cross-talk between coagulation, inflammation and the innate immune system. These patients have
significant immune cell death, which can release pro-coagulant and cytotoxic histones. In this translational study, we showed that circulating histones play a central role in critically ill COVID-19 patients with admission histone levels significantly elevated with increasing severity of COVID-19 infection.

# Tissue proteomic analysis identifies mechanisms and stages of immunopathology in fatal COVID-19

Peripheral blood inflammatory profiles are increasingly well characterised in Covid-19 but knowledge of the host response within inflamed tissues is lacking. Post-mortem lung and spleen whole-tissue proteomics identified differentially abundant proteins of mechanistic and translational interest (including MCP-3, TYMP, EN-RAGE and CSF-1). Lung proteomic clusters identified distinct disease stages that differed in pulmonary viral presence, inflammation severity, illness duration, and abundance of proteins of interest including IL-6 and IRAK1

# Hospital acquired COVID-19 in England during the first wave of the pandemic

Using data from the ISARIC4C UK COVID-19 Clinical Information Network study, this study identified that 1 in 5 hospitalised patients in England during the first wave of the pandemic caught the virus while hospitalised for other causes. However, this accounted for less than 1% of all COVID-19 cases in England, both hospitalised and not.

# Long Covid in adults discharged from UK hospitals after Covid-19

It is emerging that long-term symptoms are often present in people who
have had acute Covid-19 disease. We found that over half of patients
reported not feeling fully recovered several months after onset of
Covid-19 symptoms. The symptoms reported include fatigue, followed by
breathlessness. These findings were present in young, previously healthy
working age adults, and were most common in younger females.

# UK Paediatric COVID-19 cases in the first and second pandemic wave

The data from paediatric patients in the ISARIC4C study were used to help inform SAGE for the vaccination policy in children and young people earlier in 2022. Even though there was a change in the viral variant, a relaxation of shielding, and a return to face-to-face schooling, no evidence of increased severity in paediatric COVID-19 hospital admissions was found between the second and first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Vitamin D insufficiency in COVID-19 and influenza A

Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was present in the majority of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 (ISARIC4C study) and influenza A (MOSAIC study, 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic), correlated with severity and persisted in non-selected critical illness survivors (prior to Covid-19 pandemic) at concentrations expected to disrupt bone metabolism. These findings support early supplementation trials to determine if insufficiency is causal in progression to severe disease, and investigation of longer-term bone health outcomes.

# Using a double binding antigen assay to detect and measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

Accurate and sensitive detection of antibody to SARS-CoV-2 remains an essential component of the pandemic response. 
Measuring antibody that predicts neutralising activity and the vaccine response is an absolute requirement for laboratory-based confirmatory and reference activity.
The viral receptor binding domain (RBD) constitutes the prime target antigen for neutralising antibody. A hybrid double antigen binding assay (DABA) for anti-RBD showed a specificity of 100 % on 825 pre COVID-19 samples and a potential sensitivity of 99.6 % on 276 recovery samples, predicting quantitatively the presence of neutralising antibody determined by pseudo-type neutralization and by plaque reduction.

# Detecting SARS-CoV-2 by non-invasive means

Finding non-invasive methods to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been essential for rapid self-testing during the pandemic. This study compared gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), taken by swabbing the gums, to blood samples from patients in the ISARIC4C UK study. It was shown that GCF taken from the gums can detect the virus, and higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the GCF in the early acute phase of the illness are linked to more severe COVID-19 infections.

# Understanding the Omicron variant and how it responds to vaccination

The Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread rapidly, even in those who had been vaccinated against it. This study examined the different DNA sequence of this viral variant to determine mutations in the virus from patient blood samples from the ISARIC4C study and the effect these mutations have on the ability for the vaccination to prevent infection or illness. Understanding these alterations can help with future vaccine strategies and prevent more rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future.

# Evaluation of effectiveness of remdesivir in treating severe COVID-19

Adults with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir were compared with propensity-score matched control, identified from the ISARIC-CCP UK study. Remdesivir patients were matched to controls according to baseline underlying 14-day mortality risk. Remdesivir did not significantly improve mortality in this study.

# WHO guidelines on the use of chest imaging in COVID-19

The ISARIC-CCP UK study has aided in the creation of the 2022 World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for the use of chest imaging in COVID-19. These guidelines state that “for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, not currently hospitalized but with mild symptoms, WHO suggests using chest imaging to in addition to clinical and laboratory assessment to decide on hospital admission versus home discharge”. This guideline is based on patients first undergoing the validated risk stratification tool outlined in ISARIC-CCP.




# Distinct clinical symptom patterns in patients hospitalised with COVID-19

Although the most common symptoms of COVID-19 tend to be fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, many other symptoms have been reported, including fatigue, confusion, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Using the data from 59,011 patients in the ISARI4C study. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. On the other hand, patients presenting with confusion were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. This study suggests four different groups of patients with differing symptoms, with or without the core three symptoms, that should be treated differently if hospitalised to prevent mortality.

# Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and outcomes of COVID-19

Early in the pandemic it was suggested that pre-existing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could lead to increased disease severity in patients with COVID-19. NSAIDs are an important analgesic, particularly in those with rheumatological disease, and are widely available to the general public without prescription.
Using data from 78,674 patients in ISARIC4C, we showed that NSAID use is not associated with higher mortality or increased severity of COVID-19. To our knowledge, our prospective study includes the largest number of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 to date, and adds to the literature on the safety of NSAIDs and in-hospital outcomes. NSAIDs do not appear to increase the risk of worse in-hospital outcomes. NSAIDs are an important analgesic modality and have a vital opioid-sparing role in pain management. Patients and clinicians should be reassured by these findings that NSAIDs are safe in the context of the pandemic.

# Role of blood cytokines IL-6 and GM-CSF in severe COVID-19

We have identified new biomarkers of inflammation that both reveal the
severity of COVID-19 and set it apart from severe influenza. Many
inflammatory cytokines were found in greater numbers in severe COVID-19
and that these levels generally indicate severe disease. We identified
patterns within the data that were the most clearly linked to severe
cases of COVID-19; two cytokines in particular, IL-6 (interleukin 6) and
GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) play central
roles. With more research, we can see if GM-CSF could be used as a
marker in early disease to identify those at risk of going on to develop
more severe symptoms.

This study by Yanchung Peng, Alex Mentzer, Tao Dong and colleagues reveals that the immune system responds to many different parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This will influence vaccine design, which often focuses only on the most prominent parts of the virus. It also reveals key differences in the way immune cells fight the virus in patients who have mild disease, helping us to better understand how some people are able to fight it off without becoming very sick.

# Setting Serology Standards

# Setting the standard

ISARIC 4C defined the international reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 serology by providing the first samples to the [National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC)](https://www.nibsc.org/) from COVID-19 cases. These were used to make the WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 serology, which will be used all over the world to compare results from blood tests for COVID-19. 7 of the 11 patients who contributed to the standard were recruited by ISARIC 4C.




# Viral spike variants evading antibody-mediated immunity

We showed that the N439K viral mutation has enhanced binding affinity to
the ACE2 receptor and that this variant cause infections with similar
clinical outcomes compared to the wild type. This mutation is resistant
against neutralising monoclonal antibodies and from polyclonal sera from
persons recovered from infection. Our findings have highlighted how this
virus can mutate and the need for ongoing molecular surveillance to
guide development and usage of vaccines and therapeutics.

# Adeno-associated virus 2 infection in children with non-A-E hepatitis

An outbreak of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children was first reported in Scotland in April 2022. We carried out a detailed investigation of nine cases and 58 control subjects. Using next-generation sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction, our team compared samples and were able to **confirm the presence of AAV2 in the plasma and liver of all nine cases**. There was no AAV2 in any of the subjects in the control groups, which were made up of: age-matched healthy controls; children with adenovirus but normal liver function; and children admitted to hospital with known causes of hepatitis. AAV2 is not known to normally cause disease and often accompanies infection with adenoviruse, but we have now shown presence of the AAV2 virus associated with unexplained hepatitis in children. Larger studies are urgently needed to investigate the unanswered questions about the role of AAV2 in paediatric hepatitis cases.

# Viral RNA found in blood is not infectious

Laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection uses PCR to detect viral
RNA (vRNA) in respiratory samples. While SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been
detected in other sample types, there is very little understanding about
its clinical or laboratory significance. This has implications for
testing and for safe working in a laboratory setting. To answer this, we
undertook a systematic review for evidence of viral RNA in blood. We
also attempted viral isolation from PCR-positive blood samples. Viral
RNA was detectable at very low levels, but this was not associated with
infectious SARS-CoV-2. This work will help to inform biosafety
precautions for handling blood from COVID-19 patients.

# Developing methods of sequencing the virus

Sequencing the viral genome as the outbreak progresses is important,
particularly the identification of new variants and to identify whether
any changes in the genome will impair clinical testing. Using the
MinION/GridIONS platform, we developed a sensitive protocol to rapidly
sequence the viral genome. With this study, we showed that
amplicon-based detection and subsequent sequencing are feasible for
identifying the SARS-CoV-2 genome or nucleic acid in samples from
patients with COVID-19.

# Nuclear magnetic resonance signals in urine

Normalization to account for variation in urinary dilution is crucial for interpretation of urine metabolic profiles. Probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN) is used routinely in metabolomics but is sensitive to systematic variation shared across a large proportion of the spectral profile (>50%). Where 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is employed, the presence of urinary protein can elevate the spectral baseline and substantially impact the resulting profile. Using 1H NMR profile measurements of spot urine samples collected from hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the ISARIC 4C study, we determined that PQN coefficients are significantly correlated with observed protein levels (r2 = 0.423, p < 2.2 × 10-16). This correlation was significantly reduced (r2 = 0.163, p < 2.2 × 10-16) when using a computational method for suppression of macromolecular signals known as small molecule enhancement spectroscopy (SMolESY) for proteinic baseline removal prior to PQN. These results highlight proteinuria as a common yet overlooked source of bias in 1H NMR metabolic profiling studies which can be effectively mitigated using SMolESY or other macromolecular signal suppression methods before estimation of normalization coefficients.

# Using imaging in COVID-19 -- UK National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database

The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database (NCCID) is a repository of
chest radiographs, CT and MRI images and clinical data from COVID-19
patients across the UK, to support research and development of AI
technology and give insight into COVID-19 disease. To maximise efficient
resource utilisation in busy hospitals during the course of the
pandemic, NCCID are linking imaging data to the ISARIC4C dataset, and
aim to link to the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre
(ICNARC). ISARIC investigators are collating clinical information and
biological samples for COVID-19 cases of all ages admitted to hospitals,
while ICNARC collates detailed data from adults in the intensive care
setting. The study has also been supported by Health Data Research UK as

# Co-Infections, Secondary Infections, and Antimicrobial Usage

We investigated the frequency and microbiological details of bacterial co-infection and secondary infection, in addition to antimicrobial usage in 48,902 patients hsopitalised with COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave. We found that Covid-19 related respiratory or bloodstream bacterial infection was rare (n=1,107); the majority (71%) were secondary infection, acquired >48 hours after admission. However, antimicrobial use is high with 37% prescribed pre-hospital antimicrobials, while 85% received one or more antimicrobials during their hospital stay.
 
Based on our data, we recommend a range of existing antimicrobial stewardship interventions that should be prioritised for incorporation into COVID-19 patient care to mitigate worsening of antimicrobial resistance. As well as restricting prescribing without a confirmed diagnosis, these include tailoring the choice of antimicrobials (when required) to likely pathogens and local resistance patterns, and encouraging clinicians to discontinue antimicrobials if co-infection is deemed unlikely and tests confirm that patients do not have a bacterial infection.

We proposed and established a Diagnostic Evaluation Platform at the University of Oxford (led by Dr Alex Mentzer) which is already being used to provide evidence to the UK government about the performance of new diagnostic and antibody tests. This work is essential because if tests work well they can save lives; if they don't, they can cause enormous damage.

# COVID-19 and Cancer

<!--<https://lctc.org.uk/research/ccp-cancer-uk/>-->
The ISARIC4C investigators collaborated with Prof Carlo Palmieri and
team to characterise the first 1,797 hospitalised patients with cancer
and COVID-19. From here a new study was launched to assess the impact of
COVID-19 on people with cancer: The Clinical Characterisation Protocol
(CCP) CANCER-UK. The project will run over 12 months and will examine
questions that are important for the care of patients with cancer. With
almost 7,000 patients with both confirmed cancer and COVID-19 diagnoses
already enrolled, it will be one of the largest and most detailed
studies in the world.
The study has received funding from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)
and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), with additional
funding from The Clatterbridge Cancer Charity.

# Symptom clusters

Because of the large scale of the ISARIC-4C study, we were able to detect robust groupings of patients with different patterns of symptoms. We found four patterns that are strikingly differnet from the core symptom groups: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Each of these has a different clinical course and a different chance of death.
These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.

# New immune biomarkers for COVID-19

This study looked at a specific immune process in the body, known as the complement system. This mechanism allows microbes and damaged cells to be removed from the body, attacks pathogens, and promotes inflammation. This system is more active in patients with COVID-19 and blocking the system has been considered as a potential treatment. Blood samples from 682 hospitalised patients, including those from the ISARIC4C study, were compared to healthy individuals and multiple components of the complement system were shown to be altered. The levels of some of these markers, known as Ba, iC3b, and properdin, were shown to be associated with disease severity and death. Identifying these new biomarkers helps us to understand how the body responds to COVID-19 and allows new targets for treatment strategies.

# A delicate balance between antibody evasion and ACE2 affinity for Omicron BA.2.75.

Variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have caused successive global waves of infection. These variants, with multiple mutations in the spike protein, are thought to facilitate escape from natural and vaccine-induced immunity and often increase in affinity for ACE2. The latest variant to cause concern is BA.2.75, identified in India where it is now the dominant strain, with evidence of wider dissemination. BA.2.75 is derived from BA.2 and contains four additional mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we perform an antigenic and biophysical characterization of BA.2.75, revealing an interesting balance between humoral evasion and ACE2 receptor affinity. ACE2 affinity for BA.2.75 is increased 9-fold compared with BA.2; there is also evidence of escape of BA.2.75 from immune serum, particularly that induced by Delta infection, which may explain the rapid spread in India, where where there is a high background of Delta infection. ACE2 affinity appears to be prioritized over greater escape.

# Estimating distribution of length of stay in a multi-state model conditional on the pathway, with an application to patients hospitalised with Covid-19.

Multi-state models are used to describe how individuals transition through different states over time. The distribution of the time spent in different states, referred to as 'length of stay', is often of interest. Methods for estimating expected length of stay in a given state are well established. The focus of this paper is on the distribution of the time spent in different states conditional on the complete pathway taken through the states, which we call 'conditional length of stay'. This work is motivated by questions about length of stay in hospital wards and intensive care units among patients hospitalised due to Covid-19. Conditional length of stay estimates are useful as a way of summarising individuals' transitions through the multi-state model, and also as inputs to mathematical models used in planning hospital capacity requirements. We describe non-parametric methods for estimating conditional length of stay distributions in a multi-state model in the presence of censoring, including conditional expected length of stay (CELOS). Methods are described for an illness-death model and then for the more complex motivating example. The methods are assessed using a simulation study and shown to give unbiased estimates of CELOS, whereas naive estimates of CELOS based on empirical averages are biased in the presence of censoring. The methods are applied to estimate conditional length of stay distributions for individuals hospitalised due to Covid-19 in the UK, using data on 42,980 individuals hospitalised from March to July 2020 from the COVID19 Clinical Information Network.

# Endomembrane targeting of human OAS1 p46 augments antiviral activity.

Many host RNA sensors are positioned in the cytosol to detect viral RNA during infection. However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from cellular innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the

# Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees.

Highly transmissible Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 currently dominate globally. Here, we compare neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2. BA.2 RBD has slightly higher ACE2 affinity than BA.1 and slightly reduced neutralization by vaccine serum, possibly associated with its increased transmissibility. Neutralization differences between sub-lineages for mAbs (including therapeutics) mostly arise from variation in residues bordering the ACE2 binding site; however, more distant mutations S371F (BA.2) and R346K (BA.1.1) markedly reduce neutralization by therapeutic antibody Vir-S309. In-depth structure-and-function analyses of 27 potent RBD-binding mAbs isolated from vaccinated volunteers following breakthrough Omicron-BA.1 infection reveals that they are focused in two main clusters within the RBD, with potent right-shoulder antibodies showing increased prevalence. Selection and somatic maturation have optimized antibody potency in less-mutated epitopes and recovered potency in highly mutated epitopes. All 27 mAbs potently neutralize early pandemic strains, and many show broad reactivity with variants of concern.

# Towards nationally curated data archives for clinical radiology image analysis at scale: Learnings from national data collection in response to a pandemic.

The prevalence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease has resulted in the unprecedented collection of health data to support research. Historically, coordinating the collation of such datasets on a national scale has been challenging to execute for several reasons, including issues with data privacy, the lack of data reporting standards, interoperable technologies, and distribution methods. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease pandemic has highlighted the importance of collaboration between government bodies, healthcare institutions, academic researchers and commercial companies in overcoming these issues during times of urgency. The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database, led by NHSX, British Society of Thoracic Imaging, Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust and Faculty, is an example of such a national initiative. Here, we summarise the experiences and challenges of setting up the National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database, and the implications for future ambitions of national data curation in medical imaging to advance the safe adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare.

# A prenylated dsRNA sensor protects against severe COVID-19.

Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.

# Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 known and novel subgenomic mRNAs in cell culture, animal model, and clinical samples using LeTRS, a bioinformatic tool to identify unique sequence identifiers.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a complex strategy for the transcription of viral subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), which are targets for nucleic acid diagnostics. Each of these sgmRNAs has a unique 5' sequence, the leader-transcriptional regulatory sequence gene junction (leader-TRS junction), that can be identified using sequencing. High-resolution sequencing has been used to investigate the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the host response in cell culture and animal models and from clinical samples. LeTRS, a bioinformatics tool, was developed to identify leader-TRS junctions and can be used as a proxy to quantify sgmRNAs for understanding virus biology. LeTRS is readily adaptable for other coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or a future newly discovered coronavirus. LeTRS was tested on published data sets and novel clinical samples from patients and longitudinal samples from animal models with coronavirus disease 2019. LeTRS identified known leader-TRS junctions and identified putative novel sgmRNAs that were common across different mammalian species. This may be indicative of an evolutionary mechanism where plasticity in transcription generates novel open reading frames, which can then subject to selection pressure. The data indicated multiphasic abundance of sgmRNAs in two different animal models. This recapitulates the relative sgmRNA abundance observed in cells at early points in infection but not at late points. This pattern is reflected in some human nasopharyngeal samples and therefore has implications for transmission models and nucleic acid-based diagnostics. LeTRS provides a quantitative measure of sgmRNA abundance from sequencing data. This can be used to assess the biology of SARS-CoV-2 (or other coronaviruses) in clinical and nonclinical samples, especially to evaluate different variants and medical countermeasures that may influence viral RNA synthesis.

# A haemagglutination test for rapid detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

Serological detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for establishing rates of seroconversion in populations, and for seeking evidence for a level of antibody that may be protective against COVID-19 disease. Several high-performance commercial tests have been described, but these require centralised laboratory facilities that are comparatively expensive, and therefore not available universally. Red cell agglutination tests do not require special equipment, are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can be applied at the Point of Care. Here we describe a quantitative Haemagglutination test (HAT) for the detection of antibodies to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The HAT has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% for detection of antibodies after a PCR diagnosed infection. We will supply aliquots of the test reagent sufficient for ten thousand test wells free of charge to qualified research groups anywhere in the world.

# Two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induce robust immune responses to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

The extent to which immune responses to natural infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and immunization with vaccines protect against variants of concern (VOC) is of increasing importance. Accordingly, here we analyse antibodies and T cells of a recently vaccinated, UK cohort, alongside those recovering from natural infection in early 2020. We show that neutralization of the VOC compared to a reference isolate of the original circulating lineage, B, is reduced: more profoundly against B.1.351 than for B.1.1.7, and in responses to infection or a single dose of vaccine than to a second dose of vaccine. Importantly, high magnitude T cell responses are generated after two vaccine doses, with the majority of the T cell response directed against epitopes that are conserved between the prototype isolate B and the VOC. Vaccination is required to generate high potency immune responses to protect against these and other emergent variants.

# Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Samples from Patients with COVID-19 Illustrates Population Variation and Diverse Phenotypes, Placing the Growth Properties of Variants of Concern in Context with Other Lineages.

New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are continuing to emerge and dominate the global sequence landscapes. Several variants have been labeled variants of concern (VOCs) because they may have a transmission advantage, increased risk of morbidity and/or mortality, or immune evasion upon a background of prior infection or vaccination. Placing the VOCs in context with the underlying variability of SARS-CoV-2 is essential in understanding virus evolution and selection pressures. Dominant genome sequences and the population genetics of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalized patients were characterized. Nonsynonymous changes at a minor variant level were identified. These populations were generally preserved when isolates were amplified in cell culture. To place the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron VOCs in context, their growth was compared to clinical isolates of different lineages from earlier in the pandemic. The data indicated that the growth in cell culture of the Beta variant was more than that of the other variants in Vero E6 cells but not in hACE2-A549 cells. Looking at each time point, Beta grew more than the other VOCs in hACE2-A549 cells at 24 to 48 h postinfection. At 72 h postinfection there was no difference in the growth of any of the variants in either cell line. Overall, this work suggested that exploring the biology of SARS-CoV-2 is complicated by population dynamics and that these need to be considered with new variants. In the context of variation seen in other coronaviruses, the variants currently observed for SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in terms of their clinical spectrum of disease.

# Multi-ancestry fine mapping implicates OAS1 splicing in risk of severe COVID-19.

The OAS1/2/3 cluster has been identified as a risk locus for severe COVID-19 among individuals of European ancestry, with a protective haplotype of approximately 75 kilobases (kb) derived from Neanderthals in the chromosomal region 12q24.13. This haplotype contains a splice variant of OAS1, which occurs in people of African ancestry independently of gene flow from Neanderthals. Using trans-ancestry fine-mapping approaches in 20,779 hospitalized cases, we demonstrate that this splice variant is likely to be the SNP responsible for the association at this locus, thus strongly implicating OAS1 as an effector gene influencing COVID-19 severity.

# Mendelian randomisation identifies alternative splicing of the FAS death receptor as a mediator of severe COVID-19.

Severe COVID-19 is characterised by immunopathology and epithelial injury. Proteomic studies have identified circulating proteins that are biomarkers of severe COVID-19, but cannot distinguish correlation from causation. To address this, we performed Mendelian randomisation (MR) to identify proteins that mediate severe COVID-19. Using protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data from the SCALLOP consortium, involving meta-analysis of up to 26,494 individuals, and COVID-19 genome-wide association data from the Host Genetics Initiative, we performed MR for 157 COVID-19 severity protein biomarkers. We identified significant MR results for five proteins: FAS, TNFRSF10A, CCL2, EPHB4 and LGALS9. Further evaluation of these candidates using sensitivity analyses and colocalization testing provided strong evidence to implicate the apoptosis-associated cytokine receptor FAS as a causal mediator of severe COVID-19. This effect was specific to severe disease. Using RNA-seq data from 4,778 individuals, we demonstrate that the pQTL at the

# The COVID-19 pandemic and global environmental change: Emerging research needs.

The outbreak of COVID-19 raised numerous questions on the interactions between the occurrence of new infections, the environment, climate and health. The European Union requested the H2020 HERA project which aims at setting priorities in research on environment, climate and health, to identify relevant research needs regarding Covid-19. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health. Recovery plans are currently being discussed or implemented and the environmental and health impacts of those plans are not clearly foreseen. Clearly, COVID-19 will have a long-lasting impact on the environmental health field and will open new research perspectives and policy needs.

# Fatal COVID-19 outcomes are associated with an antibody response targeting epitopes shared with endemic coronaviruses.

The role of immune responses to previously seen endemic coronavirus epitopes in severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and disease progression has not yet been determined. Here, we show that a key characteristic of fatal outcomes with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is that the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is enriched for antibodies directed against epitopes shared with endemic beta-coronaviruses and has a lower proportion of antibodies targeting the more protective variable regions of the spike. The magnitude of antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein, its domains and subunits, and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid also correlated strongly with responses to the endemic beta-coronavirus spike proteins in individuals admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with fatal COVID-19 outcomes, but not in individuals with nonfatal outcomes. This correlation was found to be due to the antibody response directed at the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which has the highest degree of conservation between the beta-coronavirus spike proteins. Intriguingly, antibody responses to the less cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid were not significantly different in individuals who were admitted to an ICU with fatal and nonfatal outcomes, suggesting an antibody profile in individuals with fatal outcomes consistent with an "original antigenic sin" type response.

Few large cohort studies have reported data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy. We report the outcome of infected pregnancies from a collaboration formed early during the pandemic between the investigators of two registries, the UK and Global Pregnancy and Neonatal outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) study and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine (SONPM) National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry.

# Fitting to the UK COVID-19 outbreak, short-term forecasts and estimating the reproductive number.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the need for policy makers to receive timely and ongoing scientific guidance in response to this recently emerged human infectious disease. Fitting mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to the available epidemiological data provide a key statistical tool for understanding the many quantities of interest that are not explicit in the underlying epidemiological data streams. Of these, the effective reproduction number, [Formula: see text], has taken on special significance in terms of the general understanding of whether the epidemic is under control ([Formula: see text]). Unfortunately, none of the epidemiological data streams are designed for modelling, hence assimilating information from multiple (often changing) sources of data is a major challenge that is particularly stark in novel disease outbreaks. Here, focusing on the dynamics of the first wave (March-June 2020), we present in some detail the inference scheme employed for calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model to the available public health data streams, which span hospitalisations, critical care occupancy, mortality and serological testing. We then perform computational simulations, making use of the acquired parameter posterior distributions, to assess how the accuracy of short-term predictions varied over the time course of the outbreak. To conclude, we compare how refinements to data streams and model structure impact estimates of epidemiological measures, including the estimated growth rate and daily incidence.
