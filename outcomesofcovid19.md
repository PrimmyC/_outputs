Providing data and support to the British HIV Association, presentation
characteristics and outcomes of adults with and without HIV who were
hospitalized with COVID-19 at 207 centers across the UK, were compared.
HIV-positive status was associated with an increased risk of day-28
mortality among patients hospitalised for COVID-19.
